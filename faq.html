  <div class="faq-section">
    <h2>A. Legitimacy, Structure & Identity</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>1. Who are you?</summary>
      <p>
        United Earth Now (UEnow) is a grassroots international civic movement working toward
        a democratic global order based on shared responsibility, solidarity, and justice.
        We bring together people and initiatives from different regions to imagine and build
        alternatives to the current fragmented and unjust international system.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
  <summary>What does “United Earth” mean to you?</summary>
  <p>
    For us, “United Earth” expresses the long-term horizon of a unified humanity
    capable of governing itself democratically beyond borders.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is not a party label or an ideological brand, but a name for a future where
    global cooperation replaces domination and fragmentation.
  </p>
</details>


    <details>
  <summary>Is the manifesto a fixed document?</summary>
  <p>
    No. The manifesto is a starting point, not a final doctrine. It reflects the
    realities and values that motivated the creation of United Earth Now, and it is
    explicitly open to discussion, critique, and evolution as the movement grows.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is not expected to reflect every participant’s position in full — nor should
    it. Its purpose is to speak honestly about the world we live in and the challenges
    we face.
  </p>
</details>


    <details>
      <summary>2. How many people are involved?</summary>
      <p>
        We are a growing international network of volunteers, activists, researchers,
        and creatives from different regions.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>3. Are you legally registered?</summary>
      <p>
        Not yet. We currently operate as an informal, community-driven initiative
        while exploring appropriate legal frameworks for long-term work.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>4. Do you have a leadership structure?</summary>
      <p>
        We use a collaborative model. Decisions are developed through open discussion
        and consensus rather than strict hierarchy.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
  <summary>Who can join?</summary>
  <p>
    Anyone who supports global cooperation, justice, and democratic participation
    is welcome.
  </p>
  <p>
    We especially encourage participation from marginalized communities, youth,
    feminists, queer people, and voices from the Global South.
  </p>
</details>


    <details>
      <summary>5. How do you make decisions?</summary>
      <p>
        Important decisions are discussed openly within working groups
        before reaching shared conclusions.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>6. Do you publish official reports?</summary>
      <p>
        We plan to begin releasing public updates, summaries, and vision documents in 2026.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>7. What is your long-term structure?</summary>
      <p>
        A decentralized global movement coordinated through working groups,
        assemblies, and local initiatives.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>8. Do you have expert advisors?</summary>
      <p>
        We collaborate informally with individuals from academic,
        activist, and policy backgrounds.
      </p>
    </details>
  </div>

  <!-- B -->
  <div class="faq-section">
    <h2>B. Goals, Vision & Positioning</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>9. What are your long-term goals?</summary>
      <p>
        Humanity faces converging crises — climate collapse, inequality, systemic violence,
        and the erosion of human rights — yet remains divided into sovereign nation-states.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our long-term goal is to help crystallize an international civil network that connects
        struggles for human rights, climate justice, and suppressed communities with the call
        for a democratic global order rooted in popular participation.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>10. What is your political position?</summary>
      <p>
        We are not affiliated with any political party. Our position is values-based rather
        than partisan, grounded in human dignity, equality, global justice,
        and democratic self-determination beyond borders.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>11. Are you left-wing?</summary>
      <p>
        Labels vary, but our focus is substance: building systems that serve people and planet
        rather than profit, domination, or exclusion.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>12. Do you aim to reform or replace global institutions?</summary>
      <p>
        We advocate for deep transformation of global governance
        to meet 21st-century challenges democratically and effectively.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>13. Are you radical?</summary>
      <p>
        We are bold in vision and realistic about the scale of change required.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>14. Do you have a roadmap?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes. Our roadmap includes outreach, assemblies, alliance-building,
        Earth Day mobilization, and a 2026 Vision Document.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>15. Do you work inside or outside institutions?</summary>
      <p>
        Both. We collaborate with civil society while maintaining independence
        from governments and parties.
      </p>
    </details>
  </div>

  <!-- C -->
  <div class="faq-section">
    <h2>C. Strategy & Methods</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>16. What actions are planned before Earth Day?</summary>
      <p>
        Public outreach, educational content, online campaigns,
        and coordinated visibility actions.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>17. Street activism or digital?</summary>
      <p>A combination of both.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>18. Short-term or long-term collaboration?</summary>
      <p>
        We welcome both short-term and long-term cooperation,
        depending on shared goals and context.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>19. What do you want from participating groups?</summary>
      <p>
        Perspectives, expertise, lived experience, and willingness
        to engage in dialogue and collective action.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>20. What do you offer participating groups?</summary>
      <p>
        A growing international network, solidarity across borders,
        visibility, and a global democratic perspective.
      </p>
    </details>

   <details>
  <summary>Are you building alliances or coalitions?</summary>
  <p>
    We are not building a fixed ideological coalition. Cooperation is voluntary,
    non-binding, and issue-based.
  </p>
  <p>
    Groups retain their full independence and identity. Our aim is not to merge
    agendas, but to create spaces where different struggles can connect, exchange
    knowledge, and act in solidarity where interests align.
  </p>
</details>

    <details>
  <summary>What is your approach to violence and non-violence?</summary>
  <p>
    United Earth Now does not glorify violence.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, we reject the idea that non-violence can be demanded universally
    without regard for context. History shows that non-violent resistance is a
    privilege not available to everyone, especially under totalitarian or violently
    repressive regimes where dissent is met with mass repression or extermination.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our position is one of ethical realism: we oppose oppression and state violence,
    and we refuse moral double standards that condemn the resistance of oppressed
    people while ignoring the vastly greater violence already committed against them.
  </p>
</details>



    <details>
      <summary>22. Are you trying to influence governments?</summary>
      <p>
        Our first focus is civic engagement and public consciousness;
        institutional influence may emerge later.
